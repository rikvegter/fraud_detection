## Abstract of Thesis
Credit card fraud detection is a worldwide problem which comes with significant financial losses for credit card service companies. Due to the high number of transactions that occur on a daily basis there is a need for the automatization of classification of these transactions using machine learning techniques. One of the main problems within credit card fraud detection is the imbalanced within \textit{fraud} and \textit{non-fraud} transactions. Machine learning algorithms tend to be biased towards the majority class. Therefore data balancing techniques are required to overcome this class imbalance problem. This thesis provides a comparison of state-of-the-art methods in terms of a new proposed more realistic financial metric. Also a class imbalance machine learning method used to optimize the decision threshold from another domain ((called Ghost) where class imbalance occurs is trained on credit card fraud data. Ghost finds the optimal decision threshold combined with a Random Forest classifier. 
The results showed that XGBoost and Ghost perform state-of-the-art results both in terms of number of correct classification and in terms of economic efficiency resulting in almost perfect classification. A second finding of this study is that the traditional performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC show misleading results for credit card fraud detection. Current state-of-the-art results showing similar AUROC and AUPRC to XGBoost and GHOST result in a significantly lower economic efficiency.
